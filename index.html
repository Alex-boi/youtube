        <h4 id="t">Hey! here i'll tell you what i know about YouTube</h4>
        <a id="t" href="https://picsart.com/create/editor?templateSize=youtube_thumbnail">Picsart Editor</a>
        <p id="text">My favorite part about making video's is making the thumbnail i use "Picsart Editor" It's a really nice website plus if you use "jpg" its free and it doesn't have a watermark :) (all you gotta do is take good picture's (I sometimes use snapchat) it has a bunch fonts for text, it also has cute sticker's you can also upload your own sticker's and it also has pre-made shapes if you wanna use that and if you want insperation it also shows templates that other people have made to give you an idea of what you wanna use the website can also be for instagram post's, facebook post's, pinterest pin's and many more.</p>
        <a id="t" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snowcorp.vita&hl=en_US&gl=US">VITA</a>
        <p id="text">Okay, now lets talk about editing..... I use the app "VITA" its a nice app its for apple and android and it doesn't have a watermark also and I wont give you that many tips beacuse not everyone edits things diffrently all i'm gonna say is that VITA has music that isn't copyrighted and it is really nice music the transion's are a 10/10 the effects are really good quality also, VITA also has GIF's and text fonts honestly i give VITA a 100000000/10 its a really good app and i really recommend it if you wanna learn how to edit your video's.</p>
        <a id="t" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybrain.make.music&hl=en_US&gl=US">Groovepad</a>
        <p id="text">Sometimes when I wanna add music to my video's i use "Groovepad" to make beats that i like and that are personalized to you there are a lot of beats to pick from and you can remix them and make them your own (so techically it isn't copyrighted) and make something to please your ears (sorry to deaf people) its a nice app i would recommend.</p>
